# VetMate

An iOS application designed to support veterinarians in their daily work, enhanced with AI-powered assistance.  

VetMate provides tools that simplify and improve veterinary workflows:  
- **AI-powered transcription** of voice recordings for faster and more accurate documentation.  
- **Treatment suggestions** generated with the help of OpenAI, assisting veterinarians in decision-making.  
- **Structured data entry** for managing clients and their animals efficiently.  

By combining intelligent automation with intuitive design, VetMate helps veterinarians save time, increase documentation accuracy, and focus more on patient care.  

> **Note:** The source code is private as the project is still under active development. Our goal is to release VetMate on the App Store in the future.
